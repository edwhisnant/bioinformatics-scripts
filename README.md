# bioinformatics-scripts

I have created this repo as a backup for my scripts. They are, unfortunately, not very generalizable at the moment and are often custom written for the specific project I am working on. My goal for the future is to make them easier to "plug and play" so that all you need to do is change the input and outputs. I will also try and add instructions for installation or other things that may be useful for myself or anyone else in the future.

Also - the scripts may be jacked up and unusable for some prgrams I tried and failed to use. I will try and make sure they are removed and cleaned.
